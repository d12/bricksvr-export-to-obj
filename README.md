# BricksVR - Export to Obj

The open-source version of the script to export a BricksVR world to OBJ.

The code is not fully working as is but contains all the logic needed to take a set of brick data and turn it into a working OBJ and MTL.

The code may need to be adapted to work with the format of your input data.
